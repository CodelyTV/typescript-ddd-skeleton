# TypeScript basic skeleton

For now, you have all the code example available in this other repository: https://github.com/CodelyTV/typescript-ddd-example

The idea is that we'll move the basic parts (folder structure and bare minimum code to serve as skeleton) to this repository (`typescript-ddd-skeleton`) once we completely finish the `typescript-ddd-example` code. Current progress: ~95%
